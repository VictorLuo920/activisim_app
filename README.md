#### making difficult conversations easier


## App Description

Product of GA Social Impact Hackathon. Theme: Activism.

In today's rapidly changing world, social issues are becoming wildly complex, flash-button issues that are difficult to have productive conversations about. This application seeks to provide a space that acts as a hub for users to access valuable resources to better their own understanding of complex issues, interact with one another to see the dialogues about particular issues, and overall have a gamified experience that motivates users to take an active role in having difficult conversations.
